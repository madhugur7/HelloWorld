This is the very first repository created after the GitHub account was created. Just a way to learn to navigate through GitHub
This is a change made to the READEME.md file in the development1 branch. Not sure what the .md file type means. Just found out that it stands for Marked Down language.
In this case we shall commit a change for this file to a development1subA branch and then use a Pull Request to pull the change to development1 branch.
